# OrejolaFinalProject
Final Project for CSCI 2270

For this final project I will be constructing a n-ary tree. The tree will have the purpose of keeping track of employment hierarchy, and will be generally be constructed via some file that is imported. There will be no sorting for children with the same parent so hierarchy is strickly denoted by depth within the tree. For methods in the n-ary tree class I will have an initialize n-ary tree method using some inported .txt file which will include the bosses (roots) and for every subordinate (child) we will include the imediate superior (parent). The program will have the ability to print direct superiors for some employee, and list the superiors and subordinates for said employee. Also the program will have the ability to print the employee with at the bottom of the tree, i.e the employee with least power. The program will also print the boss(root) with the most subordinates.
